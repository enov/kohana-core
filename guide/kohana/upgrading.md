# Migrating from 3.3

## PSR-3 compliance of Kohana logger

Starting with version 3.4 the Kohana logger is PSR-3 compliant. This means that
it 

### The deprecation of the `add` method

Use the PSR-3 \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface methods instead of the `add` method.

The following code:

~~~
// Deprecated
Kohana::$log->add(Log::INFO, "This is an info message");
~~~

Should be migrated to this new syntax:

~~~
// Use the \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface log method
Kohana::$log->log(Log::INFO, "This is an info message");

// You can also use one of the Psr\Log\LogLevel levels
Kohana::$log->log(Psr\Log\LogLevel::INFO, "This is an info message");
~~~

### Immediate writing instead of buffering

You should use `Log_Writer::set_immediate_write` method instead of the static
`$write_on_add` property

The following code:

~~~
$writer::$write_on_add = TRUE;
~~~

Should be migrated to this new syntax:

~~~
$writer->set_immediate_write(TRUE);
~~~

### Writer flushes

The `Log::write` method has been renamed to `Log::flush`. Usually you do
not call this method, as Kohana calls it when there is an exception thrown
or at normal request shutdown.

The following code:

~~~
Kohana::$log->write();
~~~

Should be migrated to this new syntax:

~~~
Kohana::$log->flush();
~~~


### Filtering

Define filtering by attaching filters to the writer. In Kohana 3.3,
we used to specify the level filtering when attaching the writer to the log.

The following code:

~~~
$writer = new Log_File(APPPATH.'log');
Kohana::$log->attach($writer, Log::EMERGENCY, Log::ALERT);
~~~

Should be migrated to this new syntax:

~~~
use \Psr\Log\LogLevel;

$writer = new Log_File(APPPATH.'log');
$writer->attach_filter(new Log_Filter_PSRLevel([LogLevel::EMERGENCY, LogLevel::ALERT]));
Kohana::$log->attach($writer);
~~~

### Log_Writer static properties refactor

The `Log_Writer` abstract class had the following public static
properties that are no more available:

~~~
public static $timestamp;
public static $timezone;
public static $strace_level;
~~~

You should use the appropriate getter/setter on the `Log_Writer` object instead:

~~~
$writer->get_timestamp_format();
$writer->set_timestamp_format('Y-m-d');

$writer->get_timezone();
$writer->set_timezone('Asia/Beirut');

$writer->get_strace_level();
$writer->set_strace_level('Psr\Log\LogLevel::INFO');
~~~

In addition to a new API to specify the log writers default format:

~~~
$writer->get_format();
$writer->set_format('body in file:line');
~~~
